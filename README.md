# About clustering:

Clustering is a technique in the field of machine learning and data analysis, where the main goals are to group similar data into sets called clusters.

## Clustering using K-means

K-Means is one of the most well-known clustering algorithms, efficient and easy to implement. It divides the data set into a specified number of clusters (k), where each cluster is represented by its centroid. The goal is to minimize the sum of squared distances between points in a cluster and its center.
